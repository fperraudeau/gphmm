Title: Generalized pair hidden Markov chain model for sequence alignment
Description: 
  Implementation of a generalized pair hidden Markov chain model (GPHMM) that
  can be used to compute the probability of alignment between two sequences
  of nucleotides (e.g., a reference sequence and a noisy sequenced read).
  The model can be trained on a dataset where the noisy sequenced reads are known
  to have been sequenced from known reference sequences. If no training sets are
  available default parameters can be used.
